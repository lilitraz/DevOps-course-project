Requirements for local installation:

## What should I do?

The project has two main Scripts:
1. [MainScript.py](MainScript.py): Working with various actions from DevOps world
2. [AWSScript.sh](AWSScript.sh): Working with AWS EC2 and boto3

The other scripts are executed from the main scripts, depending on your choices.

You can choose each one of the main scripts and start exploring the menus.

Enjoy!
